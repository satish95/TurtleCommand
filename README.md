Problem Statement:
  Turtle is on a N * N grid, with N obstacles. The turtle can only move Forward one position and can turn Left or Right. The grid has 4 directions N, E, W, S .Assuming that the initial position of turtle is 1, 1 (bottom left corner of the grid facing North) and the grid has random obstacles in a few of its cells, given the movement instructions, find the final position of turtle and printing the grid state will be an added plus. When there is an obstacle, movement is not possible.
